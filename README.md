# Stress-Tester 😎
When we take part in a contest or solve some problem sometimes we miss some corner cases, which will lead to wrong answers or penalities. 
Its very difficult to manually try running on random testcases, and it is time consuming too.

This tool now solves this problem, basically we just need 2 different types of code one that contains the brute force solution and the other that contains the
solution to be tested, now just upload those files along with testcase generator and start it.
It will run it multiple times and will give the verdict accordingly. Hence you will hopefully get that corner case.

I implemented this project using Python ***os.system*** calls and ***Tkinter***.

You can understand its working by this flow chart :
