# Code-Tester 
During Contests sometimes our Optimized Code gets failed in some corner cases.
Its very difficult to manually try running on random testcases, and it is time consuming too.
This tool now solves this problem, basically we just need 2 different types of code one that contains the brute force solution and the other that contains the
solution to be tested, now just upload those files along with testcase generator(either gen.cpp or using test case generator tool) and start it.
It will run it multiple times and will give the verdict accordingly. Hence you will hopefully get that corner case.
I implemented this project using Python ***os.system*** calls and ***Tkinter***.

## Installation Instructions
